# Docker infrastructure for React application using Vite.js

## Get started
Clone the infrastructure:

When your React app is initialized, go in your app folder and type the following command to allow your computer to update the project files   
```shell
 sudo chown -R $USER:$USER *
```

In the `package.json, replace the dev command with the following one to enable your browser to display your React app
```json
{
